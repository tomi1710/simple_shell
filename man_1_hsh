.SH DESCRIPTION
simple_shell is, as the name, a simple command line interpreter, that provides a command line user interface
meaning that it reads lines from either file or terminal (standard input), interprets them, and executes commands. The first Unix
shell was the Thompson shell, sh, written by Ken Thompson. simple_shell will check if the first argument passed to it is a built-in function (ls, cd, pwd, etc).
If it fails, it will check whether is a built-in script, if not then it will check the PATH for the executable file. And only when it finds it, will execute the command.

.SH OVERVIEW
simple_shell interprets and executes commands that the same simple_shell reads from the standard input or files.

.RE
simple_shell can run in interactive mode by typing "./hsh" on the command line, and then hit "Enter". When the
prompt "<3" appears you are in interactive mode, meaning you can type your commands followed by "Enter". Type:
.P
.RS
.B <3 ./hsh

Also, simple_shell works in non-interactive mode with shell scripts.
.P
.RS
.B echo 'pwd' | ./hsh
